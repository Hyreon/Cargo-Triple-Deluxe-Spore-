# Cargo Triple Deluxe (Spore)

### This mod will not add new store items to existing games, so you may need to travel far to see them appear. New games should be fine.

Adds more cargo space items, increasing your maximum capacity to almost triple.

The Massive Cargo Hold is obtainable with Collector 4 or Merchant 5, a natural progression from the existing cargo containers.
It costs 1,000,000 sporebucks and acts the same as all other cargo containers, providing 5 more slots.

Additionally, 4 new cargo "extensions" have been added. These each increase your capacity by 5, allowing for an additional +20.
These share the same requirements as the other 4 upgrades, but are 3 times as expensive, and require the respective hold upgrade.
- Basic Cargo Extension requires Basic Cargo Hold
- Medium Cargo Extension requires Medium Cargo Hold
- etc.

These are sold by Diplomats, Ecologists, Bards, Scientists and Traders at half your homeworld's price.


4 more cargo "optimizations" have been added. These each increase your capacity by 5, allowing for an additional +20.
These share the same requirements as the other 4 upgrades, but are 7.5 times more expensive, and require the respective extension upgrade.
- Large Cargo Optimization requires Basic Cargo Extension
- Massive Cargo Optimization requires Massive Cargo Extension
- etc.

These are sold exclusively by your homeworld, meaning you always have to pay full price.

After getting every cargo upgrade, you will have 70 slots - 10 rows of cargo, and more than enough for your hoarding needs.
Obtaining all upgrades will require 17,100,000 sporebucks, including discounts.
